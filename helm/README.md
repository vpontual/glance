To customize css:

1. we need to put out files in the /docs/internal/static folder. Because this folder was created by the original author and we want to pull his new features; we must use a file name that is unlikely to be used by the original author.
2. we chose my-style.css as the filename.

All other customizations are inside the /helm folder
